# ECE220_Honors_Project

Introduction

The Stock market simulator that I have created from scratch makes use a comprehensive list of functions which are used to read the data of 5 stocks from a CSV file. The main code is written and implemented in C++. The purpose of this project was to try to simulate the prices of the stock market from 2013 all the way up to 2017 and create a portfolio like structure which allows it to traverse through the closing prices of each stock and keep a track of the stock owned and the money spent and earnt using the simulation. This code is used to observe the stock data and look at the general trends.


Implementation

clang++ -Wall -std=c++11 main.cpp -o main
./main

Running these commands in the terminal creates an executable file and then executes the function.
